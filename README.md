    This is the backend for <a href="https://github.com/beyarkay/eskom-calendar">eskom-calendar</a>'s API, hosted by <a href="https://www.shuttle.rs/">shuttle.rsðŸš€</a>.

(This is still a WIP, but should be usable for non-critical purposes)

## How to use it

Proper docs will be coming in the near future, as the API is still on version `v0.0.1`, but 
the endpoint is `https://eskom-calendar-api.shuttleapp.rs/v0.0.1/`. Note that you can omit the
version to opt-in to the latest version of the endpoint. So `https://eskom-calendar-api.shuttleapp.rs/list_areas`
will list all the areas according to the latest version of the API. All versions are maintained, so if
your app is working fine on `v0.0.1`, you don't have to worry about it being deprecated/removed.

The basic layout is as follows (openAPI spec is being worked on):

### List all areas
```
curl https://eskom-calendar-api.shuttleapp.rs/v0.0.1/list_areas
```

### List areas matching regex
```
curl "https://eskom-calendar-api.shuttleapp.rs/v0.0.1/list_areas/(western|eastern)-cape"
```

### Get times when the power will be out for an area
```
curl https://eskom-calendar-api.shuttleapp.rs/v0.0.1/outages/western-cape-worscester
```

### Get the full schedule for an area

(This one's got all the correct data, but some of the niceties are still just placeholders)

```
curl https://eskom-calendar-api.shuttleapp.rs/v0.0.1/schedules/western-cape-worscester
```

## Attribution and using the data (commercially or otherwise)

that

But only if you follow the following terms:

>   not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

Attribution should be done in a form similar to how
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/06/25/attribution-required/) requires it.
Specifically:

- Visually indicate that the content is from EskomCalendar in some way.
  It doesnâ€™t have to be obnoxious; a discreet text blurb is fine.

- When a specific calendar is being used, you must hyperlink directly to the website's
  version of that calendar (for example, https://eskomcalendar.co.za/ec?calendar=city-of-cape-town.ics).
  You do not have to present the full URL to the user, so long as it is clear that it is an EskomCalendar
  URL.

- If no specific calendar is being used, or the `machine_friendly.csv` file is being used, you must either
  hyperlink *directly* to the project website (https://eskomcalendar.co.za) or *directly* to the
  project github page (https://github.com/beyarkay/eskom-calendar)

By *directly*, we mean each hyperlink must point directly to the specified URL in standard HTML
visible even with JavaScript disabled, and not use a tinyurl or any other form of obfuscation
or redirection. Furthermore, the links must not be
[nofollowed](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html).
